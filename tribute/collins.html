    <ul>
<li>Thomas Collins was born into a wealthy (presumably English) family in 1732,
      as a young man bought large tracts of land, around 1760</li>
<li>Collins became active in local politics, he was
  appointed as sheriff of Kent County (1764-1767) and then held many other elected county offices</li>

<li>In 1776 he served on the Delaware Colony Constitution Committee.
  From 1776 to 1782 he served in the Delaware State Assembly</li>

<li>In 1776 it was too dangerous for the Assembly to meet in the capital, so Collins offered his home, Belmont Hall as a meeting place.</li>

<li>During the revolutionary war Collins was appointed a Lt. Colonel in the Kent County Militia.  He was later promoted to Brigadier General by George Washington.  Collins maintained a militia brigade out of his own funds.</li>

<li>Collins served under Washington in 1777 in New Jersey, but returned to Delaware and his own militia.</li>

<li>In 1786 Collins was elected unanimously by the Delaware colonial Assembly to the be the 8th President of Delaware. He served until his death in 1789.</li>

<li>The Federal Constitution was proposed in 1787 and Collins was active in gaining ratification.</li>
    </ul>

<p class="text-center">History tells us that ratification was not a forgone conclusion.  There was fierce debate both for and against the proposed constitution.  Delaware's quick acceptance of the document may have helped tip the debate toward ratification.</p>

    <p class="text-center"><em>Unfortunately Collins was unable to fulfill his dream of seeing George Washington inaugurated president, Collins died March 29, 1789, a month before Washington’s first inauguration.</em></p>

<h3 class="text-center">Belmont Hall</h3>
<p>Belmont Hall, Collins estate, remained in family hands until it was sold to the state of Delaware in 1987.</p>

<p>The state used the house as a conference center until 2008.  While it is still owned by the state, a local committee of volunteers now works with the state to preserve and promote the property for a variety of uses. </p>
<p class="light">You can tour or even rent Belmont Hall for a special event.  Information can be found <a href="http://www.belmonthall.org/">here.</a></p>
